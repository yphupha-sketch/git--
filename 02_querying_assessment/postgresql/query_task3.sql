-- Task 3: Staff Performance Review
-- At the end of the month, the owner wants to reward the hardest-working cashiers.
-- To decide fairly, they want to see how many orders each staff member has processed,
-- with the busiest staff member appearing at the top of the list.
--
-- Hint: Write a query to find the total number of orders processed by each staff member.
-- The result should show the staff member's full name (concatenated) and their total order count,
-- ordered by the count in descending order.

-- Bonus: The dataset is identical in the MongoDB database, meaning the same business insight can be retrieved.
-- Write the equivalent query for MongoDB. See query_task3_bonus.mongodb.js

-- Your thinking process (required)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------
-- Before writing your query, explain in your own words how you
-- interpreted the task, what data you need, which table(s) are
-- involved, and what SQL concepts you plan to use.
-- Write in English or Thai. Do not skip this step.

-- Your thinking: ทำที่ hint บอก ไปดูจากสไลดเก่า
