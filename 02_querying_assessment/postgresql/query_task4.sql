-- Task 4: Supplier Dependency Check
-- The manager has just heard that 'Freshest Farm Produce' may be delayed on their next delivery.
-- Before deciding whether to source from an alternative supplier, they need to know exactly
-- which ingredients depend on that supplier, so they can assess the impact on the menu.
--
-- Hint: Write a query to find the names of all ingredients supplied by 'Freshest Farm Produce'.

-- Bonus: The dataset is identical in the MongoDB database, meaning the same business insight can be retrieved.
-- Write the equivalent query for MongoDB. See query_task4_bonus.mongodb.js

-- Your thinking process (required)

-- Before writing your query, explain in your own words how you
-- interpreted the task, what data you need, which table(s) are
-- involved, and what SQL concepts you plan to use.
-- Write in English or Thai. Do not skip this step.

-- Your thinking:
--
/*select 
name
 from ingredients
 WHERE  supplier_id = 3*/

 SELECT
 ingredients.name,
 suppliers.name 

 from ingredients
 JOIN suppliers ON ingredients.supplier_id = suppliers.supplier_id 
 
 WHERE suppliers.name ='Freshest Farm Produce';
